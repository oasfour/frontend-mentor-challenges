## My process

- CSS3
- Flexbox

### Original Design

- [Desktop](./design/desktop-design.jpg)
- [Mobile](./design/mobile-design.jpg)

### What I learned

- I've never been a fan of using position:absolute just to vertically center content. Flexbox makes vertical centering much easier.

### Continued development

- _Learning_: ASP.NET, Razor, Blazor
- _Practice_: C#, CSS3, Saas, jQuery
- _Future_: React.js, Next.js, Angular
